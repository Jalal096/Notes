## Brief idea of the product
Since, we were in college there was one guy who provides notes and assignments to everyone in the class<br>
but things get hectic when every time we have contact the guy for a same document.<br>
This website will provide a better way for storing and organizing the documents.<br>

There are different section in this :<br>
1. Notebooks - If we click on this it will route to a page where there will be subject name, <br>
then click on the specific subject it will route to a page where notebooks will be available of specific subject.

2. Assignments and Experiments - Here assignments and experiments will be available of specific subjects.<br>

3. Solutions - Here solution of some questions will be provided

4. Question Papers - It's the most important one here question paper of every subjects will be provided.

Now everything can't be handle by me like uploading latest files and all so I have added one more section

5. Uploads - Here if you have any kind of file just fill the form attach the file and submit.

For Example: 

Enter your name - "Your Name"

Enter your rollno - "Your Roll No"

Select the category - "Eg. Notebook, assignment, etc,."

Select the subject - "Eg. em4, aoa, dbms, etc,."

Enter filename - "Name your file"

Select and upload your file

Now Submit


## Note : 
I have encountered with a problem which is not resolved yet.

Once you upload your file, it will not be shown in the particular section.

So what to do now ?

Kill the terminal and restart the server once again by typing the command "node ./bin/www start".

Now route to the specific link in which you have uploaded your file you will get your file.
